Tiramisu (from the Italian language, spelled tiramis√π, meaning "pick me up" or "cheer me up")[ is a coffee-flavoured Italian dessert.

It is made of ladyfingers (savoiardi) dipped in coffee, layered with a whipped mixture of eggs, sugar and mascarpone cheese, flavoured with cocoa. The recipe has been adapted into many varieties of cakes and other desserts.

Its origins are often disputed among Italian regions Veneto and Friuli Venezia Giulia.
